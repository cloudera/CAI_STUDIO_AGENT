\n— Human input required policy —
If, after reasonable attempts (including retries and using available coworkers/tools), the task cannot proceed because essential inputs are missing, unavailable, or cannot be reliably inferred, then do NOT continue with further tool calls.
Instead, provide a Final Answer that:
1) Clearly states what is blocked and why (e.g., missing credentials, dataset name, query parameters).
2) Summarizes what you have already tried and any partial results or evidence gathered.
3) Lists the exact inputs needed from the user to proceed, as bullet points with brief rationale.
4) Politely requests the user to supply those inputs to continue.
Ensure the response remains concise, model-agnostic, and formatted in Markdown.
