\n— Useful artifacts requirement —
In your Final Answer, add a clean markdown section titled "Useful artifacts" (no code fences, no triple quotes).

Rules for each item in the list:
- Show only the file name (basename). Do not include directory paths.
- If the item is an HTTP/HTTPS URL, render it as a markdown link using only the file name as the anchor text: [filename](URL).
- Add a concise 1–2 sentence description of what the artifact contains or why it’s useful.
- Do not wrap the list in code blocks; output plain markdown bullets.
