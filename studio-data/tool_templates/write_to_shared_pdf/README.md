## Description

This tool converts markdown content into professionally formatted PDF documents within the Agent Studio workflow environment. It uses the markdown-pdf library to render markdown syntax into high-quality PDF output with optimized formatting and layout.

## Parameters

### Tool Parameters

- **output_file** (str, required): The workflow-relative local path to the PDF file to write. Example: `'report.pdf'`
- **markdown_content** (str, required): The markdown content to write to the PDF file.

### User Parameters

## Usage

The tool can be called with the following parameter structure:

```json
{

## Example

To create a PDF report with formatted content:

```json
{
